    "Some words in Mandarin breaks the first and second assumptions, for example: The maple leaves turn to red, in mandarin: '枫叶红了'， 枫叶 means maple leaves, where 红了 means turn into red. However, in mandarin, 红了 is both adjective and verb, it means the maple leaves turns to red and the red at the same. This violate the first assumption and second assumption, where we can not classify the word 红了 into different groups, if we do so, we will lose some information."

Another example is the word 'will', by seeing will, we will know that it will be followed by a verb of base form, and they together will be a verb phrase.

    "My best suggestion is that every time they encounter a disagreement, they can discuss about it and add a new rule in the existing schema, and every time they encounter the same issue, they follow the rules set before. This not only save their time for debating with each other, but also create stable criterias during parsing so that the treebank is stable (although with some disagreement for some people)."

However, we can draw dependency tree so that each word is a dependency of another one, this may help with the parsing accuracy."

For example, \"I eat food yesterday\", which is correct because of the past tense, but \"Computer likes to jump\", this sentence is grammartically correct, but does not hold on the aspects of semantics and pragmatics, and the constituency parser will not be able to identify the correctness of such a sentence.\n"
